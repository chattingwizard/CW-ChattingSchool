# 🗯Freestyle

## What is it?

Writing personalized messages from scratch as an exception when no script or sequence applies.

## How to use it

- Maximum 20% of messages; 80% must be sequences
- Always with clear purpose
- Use mandatory structure: Acknowlegment + Engagement/Redirect

## What NOT to do with freestyle

- Avoid aimless or reactive messages without a purpose.
- Never let fans dominate the conversation or switch topics arbitrarily.
- Refrain from making freestyle chats sound robotic or monotonous; keep tone expressive and engaging.
