# Recruitment Process - Sales Analysis & Types | Chatting Wizard

> *The purpose of this guide is to explain the different types of sales that can happen in chat and how to achieve them.

# 🔥 What is Sexting?

Sexting﻿ is the primary method to generate sales, where the chatter provokes and maintains sexual conversations using sequences and scripts that guide the fan to purchase content. The process follows several phases:

- **Teasing:** Initial provocation with suggestive language and content.
- **PPV Drop:** Moment to offer exclusive content for sale.
- **Sexting Engagement:** Continuing with explicit language to keep interest.
- **Aftercare:** Post-care that strengthens the relationship and opens opportunities for future sales.

It is recommended to always maintain control, act with dominance, and handle objections properly to secure the sale.

# 👑Guide and Control

**Leading and Controlling is about making the fan feel heard and seen while you quietly maintain total authority over the conversation's direction.**

- **Strategic Lead**
Maintain the lead at all times by ensuring every message moves toward the goal. Do not let the fan dictate the pace or the topic; keep the interaction intentional and meaningful.
- **Assertive Guidance**
Eliminate submissive questions that give space for a "No" answer. Use your language to nudge the conversation forward with confidence, guiding the fan toward the desired action without asking for permission.
- **High-Value Posture**
Always treat the model as the "prize." Build rapport through genuine interest and personalized responses, but signal that the connection is a choice, making the fan feel chosen rather than needed.
- **Defensive Authority**
Use objection handling scripts to shut down excuses, stalling, or attempts to lower the value of the model. Keep the connection genuine but efficient—always warm, but always in control.

# ⏫ Upselling

Upselling is about efficiently and progressively raising PPV prices to avoid stagnation and maximize income by testing the spending limits of each fan.

- **Progressive Upsell**
    
    Start with a low PPV price and gradually increase it as the fan becomes more engaged and willing to spend more. This is best for new fans or those still building trust.
    
- **Specific Upsell for High-Spenders**
    
    Raise prices faster and to higher levels with fans who have already shown they spend big amounts. Adjust your price ladder based on their previous purchases and openness to higher offers.

# 🎥 Custom Content - PPDS Structure

Custom content is made tailored for each fan and can include videos, photos, or audios. To sell it, use the **PPDS structure**:

- **Prize:** Promote the desired fantasy.
- **Price:** Mention the cost with intent to sell and occasionally offer discounts.
- **Distraction Shift:** Divert the fan’s attention so they don’t focus on the price.

Full or partial payment is handled, and all orders must be documented in Airtable﻿ for the model to create the content.

# 💸 Transactional Sales

These occur when the fan knows exactly what content they want (e.g., niche content﻿). The structure is shorter but follows these steps:

- Confirm the fan can get the content.
- Engage and provoke to reinforce the content’s value.
- Drop a teaser to motivate the purchase.

This type of sale usually involves content priced between 80-200, with a friendly but controlling attitude maintained.

## Main Difference between Custom Content, Transactional Sales and Sexting

### **1. General Content**

- **Focus:** Broad appeal and audience reach.
- **Primary Driver:** **Sexting** (Active engagement & conversion, the fantasy has to be kept alive for the fan to convert to revenue smoothly).
- **Goal:** Turning fans that search for love, attention and sexting into sales.

### **2. Niche Content**

- **Focus:** Fetishes and and certain categories (Anal, Feet, B/G, etc.)
- **Primary Driver:** **Transactional Sales** (Direct purchases, the fan doesn’t care about the fantasy).
- **Goal:** Be fast and follow the steps in order to properly make transactional sales out of this content.

### **3. Specific Content (The Intersection)**

- **Focus:** Personalized videos or photos where it doesn’t matter if it’s niche or general content.
- **Primary Driver:** **Custom Content** (Premium, tailor-made requests).
- **Goal:** Maximizing income through high-value sales while giving the fans exactly what they’re looking for.
