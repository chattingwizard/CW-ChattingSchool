# 💁🏻‍♂️ Employee metrics

Employee metrics are key performance indicators that measure how well a chatter performs their job. These metrics track things like:

- **Golden Ratio:** Percentage ratio of messages containing PPV offers over total sent messages, indicating how effectively chats are being used to promote sales.
- **Unlock Ratio:** Percentage of sent PPVs that were opened by fans, reflecting how engaging and successful the PPV offers are.
- **Average Earnings Per Paying Fan:** Average revenue obtained from each fan who made a payment via PPVs or tips, helping measure the value of paying fans.
- **Response Time:** Average time the chatter takes to respond to fans, important for maintaining engagement and increasing sales opportunities.
- Along with other varied things, like overall sales, PPV Sent and PPV Opened.

These help chatters understand their performance, identify areas for improvement, and optimize sales strategies within the Infloww platform.
