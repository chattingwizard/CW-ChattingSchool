## 🕵️ Recognizing Conversation Stages

Often you will face similar situations you have already experienced. If trained, you will recognize the stage early using scripts, making the chatting and problem-solving process easier.

### **Rapport Building**

- Actively using the New Sub Rapport Sequence﻿ to gather basic fan info and redirect to a sexting sequence immediately after.

### **Teasing + Sales**:

- Engaged in sexting, either just beginning to tease or deeper with multiple PPVs opened.

### **Aftercare**:

## 🛠️ Inbetween Tools

When a fan deviates from the script, asks specific questions, or refuses certain actions, there are two tools:

- **Objection Handling**﻿: Use ready scripts to handle objections quickly, such as fans not opening PPVs, claiming no money, or saying content is expensive.
- **Freestyle**: Specific messages to redirect the conversation back to scripts and sequences. Avoid purposeless freestyle, as it slows sales.

## ❓ What is Objection Handling?

It refers to two things:

- A list of scripts that streamline your work by simplifying interactions with fans who resist following the intended sales path.
- The process of contradicting and addressing fan objections.

## 💡 Handling Objections in Different Phases

With these scripts, most of the work is prepared. You just need to identify your conversation phase and pick the right script.

Examples:

- A fan playing innocent → **/nogosexualfan**
- Fan ignoring PPV → **/followup**
- Fan ghosting mid-sequence → **/noreply**

Studying these scripts closely saves your time, boosts sales, and improves performance. Always use these scripts, avoid unnecessary freestyle, and redirect fans to the sexting sequence — your key weapon to increase sales.
