# 🎬 Video Duration Obfuscation

A technique to enhance the perceived value of PPV (Pay-Per-View) content by strategically presenting videos.

**What It Is**

- Hiding the total runtime of a video set by using OnlyFans' interface.
- Uploading multiple shorter clips instead of one, so the total duration isn't displayed upfront.

**How to Apply**

1. **Split Content**: Upload two or more short video clips as a single PPV message.
2. **Engage, Don't Reveal**: If asked about length, focus the conversation on the content's appeal rather than exact duration.
3. **Capitalize on Curiosity**: Let the hidden total duration build anticipation.

**Why It Works**

- Increases perceived value of the offer.
- Shifts fan focus from cost/time to content and experience.
- Reduces hesitation before unlocking PPV content.
