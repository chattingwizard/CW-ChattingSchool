# Workflow Recruitments

*A complete, step‑by‑step playbook with ready‑to‑send Discord messages and internal checklists. Built for speed, clarity, and motivation.*

---

## Core Roles & Ownership

- **Hiring Manager (HM)** — Owns applications, Discord server, communications, **Interview + full training session + airtable statuses + exam**
- **Rycel (Chatter Manager)** — Runs technical pass/fail during probation.
- **Team Leaders** — Monitor live during probation.
- **QA** — Only during probation: chat quality reviews and weekly reporting.

---

## Global Rules (Read First)

1. **Linear Flow** — Once training starts, no breaks until the exam. **Exception:** pause if the next day is Saturday; resume Monday.
2. **Fast Expulsion** — Any recruit who fails to apply instructions, doesn’t improve with coaching, or breaks standards is removed immediately.
3. **Voice Interaction Rule** — During trainings, microphones **must remain open**. Recruits are expected to interact verbally with the HM when prompted. Not interacting = negative evaluation.
4. **One‑by‑One Method** — Trainings are always conducted **one by one**. While one recruit chats, the others must watch closely, learn, and interact with HM when asked.
5. **Handovers** — Whenever ownership of a group changes (HM → CHM), the handover must be communicated clearly in Telegram so the next person can take over immediately without delays.
