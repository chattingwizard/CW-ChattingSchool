## SECTION F — FOUNDATIONS (9 micro-videos)

### Module: Welcome & Culture

**F-01 | Who is Chatting Wizard?**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: What CW does, mission, 5 values (Respect, Commitment, Open Mindset, Constant Progress, Enjoy the Journey)
- Example: "Here's what a normal day looks like for our team — chatters working from home, talking to fans, earning money"
- Recall: "What are the 5 values of Chatting Wizard? Pause... [answer]"

**F-02 | Your team and how coaching works**
- Duration: 1 min
- Concept: Team structure (Chatters → TLs → Chatter Manager → COO), coaching every 2 days, your TL is your direct support. ALL communication happens through Discord VOICE — not text. We want you talking, not typing.
- Example: Visual diagram of the chain. "If you have a question during your shift, you jump on Discord and TALK to your Team Leader. Voice, not text. Get used to speaking — it's faster and it's how we work."
- Recall: "How do you communicate with your Team Leader? Pause... Through Discord, using voice. Not text."

### Module: What is OnlyFans + How Money Works

**F-03 | What is OnlyFans?**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: A platform where creators share exclusive content. Fans pay to see it. Think of it like a private Instagram where people pay for access.
- Example: Visual mockup: "This is a creator's page. Fans subscribe here. Then they can see posts, receive messages, and buy extra content."
- Recall: "True or false: OnlyFans content is free for everyone. Pause... False — fans pay to access it."

**F-04 | How money flows**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: 4 revenue streams (Subscriptions, PPV, Tips, Customs). OnlyFans takes 20%, creator gets 80%. YOU earn 2% of every net sale (2% of the 80%). The more you sell, the more you make. Define PPV = Pay-Per-View = a locked photo or video the fan pays to unlock. MANTRA: Every conversation has one goal — a sale.
- Example: Visual money flow: "Fan pays $100 for a PPV → OF takes $20 → $80 remains → YOU get 2% of that = $1.60 from that single sale. Now imagine you make 20 sales in a shift. That adds up. The more you sell, the more you earn."
- Recall: "What percentage do YOU earn from every net sale? Pause... 2% of the net (after OnlyFans takes their 20%)."

**F-05 | Why do fans pay?**
- Duration: 1 min
- Concept: 4 reasons — connection (they feel close to the creator), fantasy (they get what they can't in real life), exclusivity (only they have this), attention (the creator talks to THEM).
- Example: "Imagine a fan named Mike. He follows 10 Instagram models. None of them talk to him. But on OnlyFans, the model says 'Hey Mike, I was thinking about you.' That attention is what he pays for."
- Recall: "Name 2 reasons fans pay on OnlyFans. Pause... Connection and attention (or any 2 of the 4)."

### Module: Your Role + What a Shift Looks Like

**F-06 | What does a chatter actually do?**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: You chat with fans AS the model. You ARE her. Your goal: build a connection AND sell content (PPVs + customs). You use scripts for 80% of your messages.
- Example: "A fan says 'Hey sexy.' You don't reply as yourself. You reply as the model. If she's playful and uses emojis, so do you. You type /n and the script gives you the perfect first message."
- Recall: "Do you chat as yourself or as the model? Pause... As the model. Always."

**F-07 | A typical shift: start to finish**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: 8-hour shift overview: log in → open Unread tab → backread → prioritize fans → respond using scripts → sell PPVs → do handoff notes. You manage 5-15 fans at once.
- Example: Visual timeline: "9:00 AM — Log in, check Unread. 9:10 — Backread 3 active conversations. 9:20 — Start replying to priority fans. 12:00 — You've sent 2 PPVs, 1 got bought. 5:00 PM — Write handoff notes for every active chat."
- Recall: "What's the first thing you do when you start your shift? Pause... Go to the Unread tab."

### Module: Banned Topics

**F-08 | The banned topics list**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: CRITICAL RULES. Breaking these = instant termination + possible account ban. Full list: underage references, non-consensual acts, meet-ups, illegal substances, extreme fetishes, outside payment methods, racism. These are OnlyFans rules — not just our rules.
- Example: Show each banned topic with a red X: "A fan says 'You look like a young teenager.' RED FLAG. A fan says 'Let's meet in person.' RED FLAG. A fan says 'Can I pay you on Venmo?' RED FLAG."
- Recall: "A fan asks to meet up in person. What do you do? Pause... Reject it immediately. This is a banned topic."

**F-09 | How to handle banned requests**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: 3 steps: reject → show discomfort → redirect. Never play along. Never use alternate spellings to get around it. Never linger on the topic. When it's serious → escalate to your Team Leader immediately.
- Example: "Fan: 'Can we meet up sometime?' You: 'Aw babe I wish, but I like keeping this our little private space. I'd rather show you something special right here...' See? Reject, show it's not happening, redirect to content."
- Recall: "A fan keeps pushing a banned topic after you redirect. What do you do? Pause... Escalate to your Team Leader immediately."

### After all Foundations videos:
- **Interactive quiz** (5 questions, multiple choice, instant feedback)
- **Exercise: Read a Real Chat** (interactive annotated conversation on the website)

## SECTION T — TOOLS & SCRIPTS (12 micro-videos)

### Module: Infloww Walkthrough

**T-01 | Infloww basics: your workspace**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Infloww is the tool where you do everything. Dashboard, Analytics, Messages Pro, Growth tabs. How to open multiple model inboxes. The Unread tab is your starting point.
- Example: Screen recording style: "This is your dashboard. Click here for messages. You can see all your models here. Click on a model → you see their inbox. The Unread tab shows you who needs a reply."
- Recall: "Where do you find your messages in Infloww? Pause... In the Messages Pro tab."

**T-02 | Fan insights: reading a fan's profile**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Every fan has a profile with key info. Subscription time = when they joined. Total spent = how much money they've spent. Highest purchase. Last paid. This tells you WHO this fan is and HOW to treat them.
- Example: "Look at this fan: subscribed 2 days ago, $0 spent. This is a NEW SUB — priority. Now look at this fan: subscribed 15 days ago, $0 spent. This is a TIME WASTER — low priority. The data tells you everything."
- Recall: "A fan subscribed 1 day ago and has spent $0. Is he a new sub or a time waster? Pause... A new sub — he's in the 48-hour window."

**T-03 | Fan notes and the Vault**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Fan Notes = where you write what you know about the fan (age, job, hobbies, preferences). This is critical for handoffs. Vault Pro = where you find content to send. NEVER use the "All Media" folder — it contains content not approved for sending.
- Example: "You learn the fan is 32, works in IT, likes brunettes. You write in notes: '32, IT, likes brunettes, completed sexting 1x, prefers video over photo.' The next chatter reads this and knows exactly who they're talking to."
- Recall: "Why should you NEVER use the 'All Media' folder in the Vault? Pause... Because it contains unapproved content."

**T-04 | Mass Messages and your metrics**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Mass Messages (MMs) = messages sent to many fans at once. Must exclude certain tags (Forbidden, TW, Muted, Whale, Custom). Your performance is measured by: Golden Ratio, Unlock Ratio, Response Time. Keep response time under 2 minutes.
- Example: "You're about to send a Mass Message. Before you hit send: did you exclude Forbidden? Muted? TW? Whale? Custom? If you didn't, you'll send content to fans who shouldn't get it — and that's a serious mistake."
- Recall: "What should your response time be? Pause... Under 2 minutes."

### Module: Scripts & Sequences 101

**T-05 | What are scripts and why we use them**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Scripts = pre-written message chains. They predict what the fan will say and give you the perfect response. Why? Maximize sales, reduce your mental load, stay consistent. The 80/20 rule: 80% of your messages come from scripts.
- Example: "Without scripts: you think for 2 minutes, write something, hope it works. With scripts: you type /n, the perfect message appears, you send it in 5 seconds. The fan responds. The script tells you what to say next. It's like having a cheat code."
- Recall: "What percentage of your messages should come from scripts? Pause... 80%."

**T-06 | How to activate scripts**
- Duration: 1 min
- Concept: Type / followed by the command name. /n = new sub welcome. /s = sexting. /price = when fan says it's too expensive. The command activates a SEQUENCE — a chain of messages you follow step by step.
- Example: "A new fan subscribes. You type /n in the chat. The script gives you the Welcome message. You send it. The fan replies. You go to the next step in the sequence. It's that simple."
- Recall: "What do you type to start the welcome sequence for a new subscriber? Pause... /n"

**T-07 | Types of scripts**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: 5 categories. Journey sequences (the main flow: Welcome, Rapport, Teasing, Sexting, Aftercare). Objection (OBJ) = when fan pushes back on price. Resistance (RES) = when fan won't go sexual. Situational (SIT) = specific scenarios. No Response (NR) = when fan goes silent.
- Example: "Fan says 'That's too expensive.' You don't panic. You type /price. The objection script tells you exactly what to say. Fan goes silent for 4 minutes? You type the NR wave. Every situation has a script."
- Recall: "A fan says 'I don't have money.' Which script type is this? Pause... Objection (OBJ). You'd type /nomoney."

### Module: Model Personas

**T-08 | You ARE the model**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Every model has a character profile: name, age, personality, hobbies, how she talks. You must become her. Her voice, her words, her vibe. Never break character. Where to find model info: chatter guide + Infloww notes. Scripts are already adapted per model.
- Example: "Model A is 23, loves fitness, talks casually with lots of emojis. Model B is 28, more sophisticated, uses longer sentences. Same fan says 'Hey beautiful.' Model A replies: 'heyyy cutie!! 😘 how's ur day going?' Model B replies: 'Well hello there handsome... I've been thinking about you.' Same situation, completely different voice."
- Recall: "Can you use the same tone and words for every model? Pause... No. Each model has her own personality and voice."

### Module: The Journey Overview + PPV Ladder

**T-09 | The fan journey from start to finish**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Every fan follows a path: Welcome → Auto Follow-up → Rapport → Teasing Bridge → Sexting → Aftercare → Re-engagement. Each phase has its own scripts (W-1, AF-1, R-1 to R-9, TB-1 to TB-7, S1-1 to S1-22, AC-1 to AC-3). You guide the fan through this journey.
- Example: Visual journey map: "Fan subscribes → you send Welcome (W-1) → fan replies → you start Rapport (R-1, ask their name) → after a few messages, you transition to Teasing (TB-1) → then Sexting (S1-1) → PPVs are dropped during sexting → after the session, Aftercare (AC-1)."
- Recall: "What comes after Rapport in the journey? Pause... Teasing Bridge."

**T-10 | The PPV Ladder**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: PPV 0 = FREE hook (teaser image). PPV 1 = $5-15 (break the payment barrier — most important sale). PPV 2 = $20-35. PPV 3 = $35-50. PPV 4+ = $50+. You build trust first, then ask for money. Each PPV is higher than the last. Fast-track rule: if the fan is sexual in the first 3 messages → skip Rapport, go to Teasing Bridge.
- Example: "Think of it like stairs. The fan starts at the bottom. PPV 0 is free — it gets them excited. PPV 1 is cheap — it gets them to take out their wallet. Once they've paid once, paying again is easy. PPV 2, 3, 4 go higher because the fan is already invested."
- Recall: "What is the purpose of PPV 0? Pause... It's a FREE teaser to build excitement — no cost to the fan."

### Module: The 48-Hour Rule

**T-11 | The 48-Hour Rule**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: The first 48-72 hours after a fan subscribes is the most valuable window. Goal: complete a full sexting session with new fans. Welcome Journey prices are intentionally lower = we want conversion, not max revenue. After the first sexting: invest heavily in aftercare. The aftercare after a FIRST sexting is more important than after a 10th sexting.
- Example: "A fan subscribes at 3 PM on Monday. You have until roughly Wednesday 3 PM to complete a full sexting session with him. That's your golden window. After that, if he hasn't spent anything, he becomes a time waster and your approach changes completely."
- Recall: "Why are Welcome Journey prices lower than normal? Pause... Because we prioritize conversion — getting the fan to buy for the first time is more important than the price."

**T-12 | Time Wasters: what to do**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Time Waster = subscribed 48-72+ hours, $0 spent. STOP pushing the standard sexting journey. Switch to bundle/promotion selling. Lower prices if needed — some revenue > zero revenue. These fans are LOWEST priority. Don't waste too much time on them.
- Example: "Fan subscribed 5 days ago. Total spent: $0. He messages you 'Hey babe.' This is a time waster. Don't start the Rapport journey. Instead, send him a deal: 'Hey! I have a special package just for you — 3 exclusive photos for $25. Limited time only.' Bundles and promotions."
- Recall: "A fan has been subscribed for 6 days and spent $0. What's your strategy? Pause... Bundle/promotion selling. He's a time waster."

## SECTION J — THE JOURNEY (10 micro-videos)

### Module: Rapport & Teasing Bridge

**J-01 | Rapport: getting to know the fan**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Rapport phase (R-1 to R-9). Ask questions, gather info (name, age, job, hobbies, preferences). Log everything in fan notes. Timing: 30-90 seconds between messages. Message length rules: mostly short (1 sentence), some micro (2-5 words), occasionally medium (2 sentences). Never send walls of text.
- Example: "Script R-1: 'Heyyy! So glad you're here! What's your name babe?' Fan: 'I'm David.' R-2: 'David! Love that name 😘 What do you do for work?' Fan: 'I'm an engineer.' You write in notes: 'David, engineer.' R-3: 'Omg that's so hot, smart guys are my weakness... what do you do for fun?' See? Short messages, questions, gathering info."
- Recall: "What should you do with the info a fan tells you during Rapport? Pause... Write it in the fan notes. Always."

**J-02 | Teasing Bridge: from friendly to flirty**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Teasing Bridge (TB-1 to TB-7). Smooth transition from friendly to flirty. The fan should barely notice the shift. PPV 0 = free teaser image to build anticipation. This is where you start building sexual tension without being explicit.
- Example: "End of Rapport: you know his name, job, hobbies. Now TB-1: 'You know... I've been in bed all morning and I can't stop thinking about something naughty 🙈' See? Still playful, but now flirty. TB-3: 'I took a photo earlier... it's pretty hot. Want to see? 😏' → Send PPV 0 (free teaser). The fan is hooked."
- Recall: "What is PPV 0? Pause... A free teaser image — no cost to the fan. It builds anticipation."

### Module: Sexting & PPV Drops

**J-03 | The sexting sequence explained**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Sexting sequence (S1-1 to S1-22). The full flow with PPV drops at key moments. Timing: 15-45 seconds between messages (faster than Rapport). WAIT instructions = real pauses to build anticipation (use this time for other fans). Max 2 messages in a row without fan reply. Guide & Control: you lead, never the fan. Never ask "Do you want to...?" — tell them what's happening.
- Example: "S1-3: 'I can't stop touching myself thinking about you...' S1-5: 'I just took this for you... you're the only one who gets to see this 🤫' → Drop PPV 1 ($10). Don't say 'Would you like to see a photo?' Say 'I made this for you.' You control the conversation."
- Recall: "Should you ask the fan 'Do you want to see a photo?' before sending a PPV? Pause... No. Never ask permission. You guide and control."

**J-04 | PPV drops: when and how to sell**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: PPV 1 ($5-15) = break the payment barrier. Most important sale because once they pay once, they'll pay again. PPV 2-4 increase in price as excitement builds. Drop PPVs at peak excitement moments. For new subs: welcome prices are lower (conversion > revenue). For returning fans: normal or higher prices.
- Example: "Fan is excited, sending fast replies. You send S1-5 + PPV 1 at $10. Fan buys! Now they're invested. 5 messages later, S1-12 + PPV 2 at $25. Fan buys again. 8 messages later, S1-18 + PPV 3 at $40. Each PPV rides the wave of excitement from the last one."
- Recall: "Why is PPV 1 the most important sale? Pause... Because once a fan pays for the first time, it's much easier to get them to pay again."

**J-05 | Welcome pricing vs normal pricing**
- Duration: 1 min
- Concept: New subscribers get lower prices during the Welcome Journey. This is BY DESIGN. The goal is conversion (getting them to pay for the first time) not maximum revenue. Once they've completed a full sexting session and paid multiple times, future sessions use normal (higher) pricing.
- Example: "New sub PPV 1: $8. Returning fan PPV 1: $15. New sub PPV 3: $30. Returning fan PPV 3: $50. Lower prices for new subs because the FIRST full sexting session is what hooks them for life."
- Recall: "Should you charge a new subscriber the same prices as a returning fan? Pause... No. New subs get lower welcome prices to maximize conversion."

### Module: Aftercare & Re-engagement

**J-06 | Aftercare: why it's more important than you think**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Aftercare scripts (AC-1 to AC-3). After the sexting session ends, DO NOT go cold. The fan just had an emotional experience. Show warmth, appreciation, "that was special." CRITICAL: aftercare after a FIRST sexting is the most important you'll ever do. This is where the long-term connection is built.
- Example: "Sexting just ended. Fan sent his last message. DON'T disappear. AC-1: 'Mmm that was amazing babe... you really know how to make me feel good 😘' AC-2: 'I'm still thinking about what we just did... you're different from the others.' AC-3: 'Can't wait to do that again with you... sweet dreams handsome 💕' This makes him come back."
- Recall: "The sexting just ended. Should you move on to the next fan immediately? Pause... No. Do aftercare first. Especially after a first sexting — it's critical for retention."

**J-07 | Re-engagement and custom pitching**
- Duration: 1 min
- Concept: Re-engagement (RE-1, RE-2) = bringing back inactive fans who stopped messaging. Also: aftercare is a great moment to pitch customs. "I'd love to make something special just for you..." The fan is emotionally connected = more likely to say yes.
- Example: "Fan hasn't messaged in 3 days. RE-1: 'Hey babe... I've missed you. Been thinking about last time 😏 Want to pick up where we left off?' Also: during aftercare: 'You know... I've been wanting to make a video just for you. Something no one else gets to see. Would you like that?'"
- Recall: "When is the best time to pitch a custom content order? Pause... During aftercare, when the fan is emotionally connected."

### Module: Branch Rules & NR Waves

**J-08 | The 3 branch rules**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: After EVERY PPV drop, 3 things can happen: 1) Fan BOUGHT → continue sequence to next PPV. 2) Fan is SILENT (3+ min) → start NR wave. 3) Fan OBJECTS → go to OBJ script. This is a flowchart. Memorize it. Every PPV drop = same 3 outcomes.
- Example: Visual flowchart: "You drop PPV 1. Wait 3 minutes. Did he buy? YES → continue to S1-8, heading toward PPV 2. NO, he's silent? → Start NR-W1. NO, he said 'too expensive'? → Type /price for the objection script."
- Recall: "A fan has been silent for 4 minutes after you sent a PPV. What do you do? Pause... Start a No Response wave (NR-W1)."

**J-09 | No Response waves: 5 attempts, 5 angles**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: NR Wave system: 5 waves, each with a different approach. Hard cap at 5 — after wave 5, you stop. NR-W1: playful nudge. NR-W2: curiosity hook. NR-W3: emotional pull. NR-W4: scarcity. NR-W5: final attempt. If he comes back at ANY wave → return to the sexting sequence.
- Example: "PPV dropped, fan goes silent. NR-W1: 'Babe? Don't leave me hanging... 🥺' (2 min wait). Still silent. NR-W2: 'I have something even better I've been saving... but only if you're still there 👀' (3 min wait). Still silent. NR-W3: 'I was really enjoying our time together... made me feel something special' (5 min wait). And so on up to W5. After W5: stop. Move on."
- Recall: "What's the maximum number of NR waves? Pause... 5. After wave 5, you stop."

### Module: Fan Assessment & Prioritization

**J-10 | Who gets your attention first?**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Priority order: 1) Active sexting 2) New subscribers (first 48h) 3) Whales (big spenders) 4) Past spenders 5) Time wasters (lowest). How fan info affects pricing: high spender → higher PPV. New fan → welcome prices. Time waster → deals/bundles. Backreading: always check past conversations before replying.
- Example: "You have 6 fans in your inbox. Fan A: mid-sexting. Fan B: new sub, 3 hours old. Fan C: whale, $500 spent total. Fan D: subscribed 2 weeks ago, spent $30 last week. Fan E: 5 days, $0 spent. Fan F: 10 days, $0 spent. Priority: A → B → C → D → E → F. A is mid-sale. B is golden window. C is high value. E and F are time wasters = last."
- Recall: "Between a new subscriber (2 hours old) and a whale ($500 spent) who both messaged you, who do you reply to first? Pause... The new subscriber. The 48-hour window is more urgent."

### After all Journey videos:
- **Interactive quiz** (5 questions)
- **Chat Simulator: Full Journey** (rapport → teasing → sexting → PPV → branch rules → aftercare)

---

## SECTION A — ADVANCED (7 micro-videos)

### Module: Top 10 Objection Scripts

**A-01 | Objections part 1: price, free content, no money, followup, expensive**
- Duration: 2.5 min
- Concept: 5 objection scripts with exact responses. /price (reframe value), /freecontent (redirect to PPV), /nomoney (downgrade or seed+return), /followup (nudge to open PPV), /expensive (value justification).
- Example: "Fan: 'That's too expensive.' You type /price. Script: 'Babe this is just for you... I spent 20 minutes making it and you're the only one who'll ever see it. It's worth every penny 😘' See? Don't lower the price. Reframe the value."
- Recall: "A fan says 'Send me something for free.' What script do you use? Pause... /freecontent — redirect to PPV, never send free content."

**A-02 | Objections part 2: noreply, nogosexualfan, discount, card, cum**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: 5 more objection scripts. /noreply (re-engagement hook), /nogosexualfan (playful redirection), /discount (counter-offer), /cardnowork (alternative solutions), /cum (delay + maximize spend).
- Example: "Fan: 'Can I get a discount?' You type /discount. Script: 'Tell you what babe... I'll make you a special deal. Buy this one at full price and I'll give you something extra that nobody else gets 😏' Counter-offer. You give value, not a discount."
- Recall: "The fan says his card doesn't work. What script do you use? Pause... /cardnowork — help with alternative solutions."

### Module: Custom Content Sales (TPDs)

**A-03 | What are customs and when to pitch**
- Duration: 1.5 min
- Concept: Custom = photo or video made specifically for one fan (their name, their request). When to pitch: during Aftercare, when a fan mentions a fantasy, or when they ask. Pricing: solo photos from $50+, solo videos from $150-200+. ALWAYS collect payment BEFORE making the custom.
- Example: "Fan during aftercare: 'I wish I could see you in red lingerie.' That's your opening. He just told you what he wants. This is where you use TPDs to sell a custom photo for $60+ or a custom video for $150+."
- Recall: "Should you make the custom content before or after receiving payment? Pause... After. ALWAYS collect payment first."

**A-04 | The TPDs method step by step**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: TPDs = Teasing → Price → Distraction Shift. Step 1 (T): Send a hot/teasing message to build excitement. Step 2 (P): Drop the price while the fan is excited. Step 3 (Ds): Immediately ask a question to redirect attention away from the price. Rules: never promise content the model hasn't agreed to. Never give exact delivery time.
- Example: "Fan wants a custom video. T: 'Mmm I'd love to make that just for you... imagine me doing exactly what you want, saying your name 🤤' P: 'That would be $150 babe, and I'll make it SO worth it' Ds: 'So tell me... what would you want me to wear? Or should I start with nothing on? 😏' See? Teasing → Price → Distract."
- Recall: "What are the 3 steps of TPDs? Pause... Teasing, Price, Distraction Shift."

### Module: Multitasking

**A-05 | Juggling multiple fans at once**
- Duration: 2.5 min
- Concept: You'll chat with 5-15 fans at the same time. Track where each fan is using notes + Infloww status. The WAIT trick: when a script says WAIT 2 min → respond to other fans during that time. Priority switching: active sexting > new sub > NR follow-up > time waster. It's normal to feel overwhelmed the first week — it gets easier.
- Example: "Fan A is mid-sexting, script says WAIT 2 min. During those 2 minutes: reply to Fan B (new sub, send R-2). Check Fan C (silent 5 min, send NR-W1). Fan A's 2 minutes are up → go back to Fan A. You're constantly rotating between fans using the wait times."
- Recall: "A script says WAIT 2 minutes. What do you do during those 2 minutes? Pause... Respond to other fans. Use every second."

### Module: Shift Routine

**A-06 | Your shift checklist: start and handoff**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: START: Unread tab → log in → backread → prioritize → respond → send Mass Message if scheduled → keep reply time under 2 min. HANDOFF: Update fan notes for ALL conversations → flag mid-sexting fans → note issues for TL → the next chatter should pick up without asking questions.
- Example: "End of your shift. Fan D was mid-sexting when your shift ended. In notes you write: 'Mid-sexting, just sent S1-14, PPV 2 bought, about to send PPV 3. Fan is very engaged. Continue S1-15 next.' The next chatter reads this and knows EXACTLY where to pick up."
- Recall: "What's the goal of your handoff notes? Pause... The next chatter can continue any conversation without asking you questions."

### Module: Common Mistakes

**A-07 | 10 mistakes every new chatter makes**
- Duration: 2 min
- Concept: Quick-fire list of the 10 most common errors with a one-line explanation for each. Sending 3+ messages without reply. Freestyling when a script exists. Ignoring fan notes. PPV too early. Free explicit content. Slow reply time. Breaking character. Not logging fan info. Too much time on time wasters. Weak aftercare.
- Example: "Mistake #4: Sending a PPV before building tension. Fan just said 'Hey.' You immediately send a $20 PPV. He ignores it. Why? Because you skipped Rapport and Teasing. You haven't built ANY desire yet. The PPV has zero value to him."
- Recall: "Name the #1 mistake related to fan notes. Pause... Not logging fan info — the next chatter starts blind."

### After all Advanced videos:

## PRODUCTION PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: Foundations (9 videos)
Build and test the full pipeline here. These are the simplest concepts and set the tone for everything.

### Phase 2: Tools & Scripts (12 videos)
Most critical for the self-study model. Recruits MUST know Infloww and scripts before live sessions.

### Phase 3: The Journey (10 videos)
The core chatting knowledge. This is where the money-making skills are taught.

### Phase 4: Advanced (7 videos)
Final polish before go-live. Objections and customs are the advanced skills.
