For now, I would love to keep getting to know you better. Where are you from, by the way? See what happened? You did not reject the fan. You kept the dream alive. You showed vulnerability. And you redirected the conversation. The fan still feels like there is a chance, and they keep spending. That is the script. Never kill the illusion."

Like, hey, did you end up going to that concert you told me about? The key is speed. Ignore the banned topic, redirect immediately, and keep the conversation alive. The fan should barely notice you skipped over it."
