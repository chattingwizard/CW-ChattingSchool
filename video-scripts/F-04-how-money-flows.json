The agency and creator split that eighty dollars. And you, the chatter, earn two percent of every net sale. That's one dollar sixty from that single sale. It sounds small, but think about it. If you make twenty sales in one shift, that adds up fast. The more you sell, the more you make. Remember this. Every conversation has one goal. A sale."
