New subscribers and active conversations always come first. Then you start replying, using scripts for every interaction. Throughout your shift, you'll sell PPVs and manage five to fifteen fans at the same time. At the end of your shift, you write handoff notes for every active conversation. The next chatter should be able to pick up without asking you a single question."
