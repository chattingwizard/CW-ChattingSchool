## What Chatters Do
- Chat on OnlyFans as if they ARE the model (the model's persona)
- Goal: build rapport with fans, keep them engaged, and sell PPV content (photos/videos)
- Revenue comes from: PPV unlocks, tips, custom content, subscriptions
- Chatters work in shifts (8-12 hours), managing multiple fans simultaneously
- They follow scripts and strategies but must adapt to each fan's personality
- KPIs tracked: Sales/hr, CVR (conversion rate), Unlock Rate, Golden Ratio, Messages/hr, Reply Time

## KPI Thresholds (current)
| KPI | Red Flag (danger) | Green Flag (great) | Weight |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Sales/hr | < $20 | > $50 | 35% (most important) |
| CVR | < 7% | > 9% | 15% |
| Unlock Rate | < 30% | > 40% | 10% |
| Golden Ratio | < 1.5% | > 4% | 10% |
| Messages/hr | < 70 | > 90 | 15% |
| Reply Time | > 2.5 min | < 1 min | 15% |

## Script Framework (from CW-ScriptManager)
The script system follows a journey-based approach:
1. **Welcome** — First message when fan subscribes
2. **AF (Auto-Follow)** — Automated initial outreach
3. **Rapport Building** — Get to know the fan, build connection
4. **Teasing Bridge** — Transition from casual to flirty/sexual
5. **Sexting** — Revenue-generating conversation with PPV offers
6. **Aftercare** — Post-purchase warmth to retain fan
7. **Re-engagement** — Bring back inactive fans

### Psychology Toolkit
- Arousal escalation (gradual, never rush)
- Ego amplification (make fan feel special/desired)
- Attainability illusion (fan believes model is within reach)
- Scarcity/urgency (limited time, "just for you")
- Vulnerability (model shares "private" moments)
- Positive spin (never shame, always redirect)

### PPV Ladder
- Tier 1: $5-15 (teasing/suggestive)
- Tier 2: $15-35 (explicit)
- Tier 3: $35-75 (premium/custom)
- Tier 4: $75+ (girlfriend experience, video calls, customs)

### OBJ/RES/SIT System
- OBJ = Objection (fan pushback: "too expensive", "I'm broke", etc.)
- RES = Response (scripted reply to overcome objection)
- SIT = Situation (contextual scenarios requiring specific handling)
- 12 core techniques for objection handling
