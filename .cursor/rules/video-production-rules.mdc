# Chatting School — Content Quality Rules

## RULE 0: AUDIENCE PROFILE (never forget this)
The person consuming this content:
- Has NEVER heard of OnlyFans, chatting, or this industry
- English is their SECOND language (Filipino, African, Venezuelan backgrounds)
- May have limited formal education / low cognitive load tolerance
- Needs EVERYTHING explained from scratch, step by step
- Cannot be expected to "just know" anything

## RULE 1: ZERO UNDEFINED TERMS
**NEVER use a word or concept before it has been explicitly defined in the curriculum.**
- Before saying "fan", you MUST have already explained: "A fan is a person who pays money to follow and talk to a creator on OnlyFans."
- Before saying "chatter", you MUST have already explained: "A chatter is the person (you) who talks to fans on behalf of the creator."
- Before saying "PPV", you MUST have already explained: "PPV stands for Pay Per View — a locked photo or video that a fan pays to unlock."
- This applies to EVERY term: OnlyFans, creator, subscriber, tip, custom, script, sequence, GFE, rapport, sexting, Infloww, etc.
- If a video needs to reference a term not yet taught, it MUST include a brief inline definition the FIRST time it appears.
- When in doubt: DEFINE IT. Over-explaining is always better than under-explaining for this audience.

### Term Introduction Order (mandatory)
Terms must be introduced in this order across the curriculum. A video CANNOT use a term from a later position without defining it first:
1. OnlyFans (the platform)
2. Creator / Model (the person who owns the account)
3. Fan / Subscriber (the person who pays)
4. Chatter (you — the person who talks to fans)
5. Content (photos, videos, messages)
6. Subscription (monthly fee to follow a creator)
7. PPV — Pay Per View (locked content fans pay to unlock)
8. Tip (extra money fans send)
9. Custom / Custom content (personalized content for one fan)
10. Script / Sequence (pre-written messages you use)
11. All other industry terms (GFE, rapport, sexting, objection handling, etc.)

## RULE 2: CONTENT STRUCTURE — Every micro-video follows this format
1. **Concept** (15-30 sec): Explain ONE idea in simple words. Define any new terms immediately.
2. **Practical Example** (30-60 sec): Show a LITERAL, concrete example. Dialogue, numbers, scenarios.
3. **Recall Question** (10-15 sec): "Pause and think... [question]. The answer is [answer]."
- Total target: 1-2 minutes per video. NEVER exceed 2.5 minutes.
- ONE concept per video. If you need two concepts, make two videos.

## RULE 3: LANGUAGE STANDARDS
- Use the SIMPLEST possible words. "Get" not "obtain". "Help" not "assist". "Talk" not "communicate".
- Sentences: MAX 12 words. Prefer 6-8.
- No passive voice. "You talk to fans" not "Fans are talked to by you."
- When introducing a technical term (PPV, GFE, etc.): say the term, immediately define it in plain words, then use it.
- Repeat key terms multiple times after introduction to reinforce.
- The "sale mantra" must appear in every section: "Remember: every conversation has one goal — a sale."

## RULE 4: VISUAL STANDARDS — Videos are NOT just text
Every content scene MUST include at least 2 of these visual elements:
- **Colored boxes/cards**: Key concepts in colored panels (blue, green, purple, orange)
- **Diagrams**: Flow arrows, chains (e.g., Fan → pays → Creator → Agency → You)
- **Icons/symbols**: Dollar signs ($), chat bubbles, checkmarks, X marks, arrows, stars
- **Number highlights**: Big numbers for percentages, prices, counts (e.g., "20%" in a large colored circle)
- **Comparison layouts**: Side-by-side "Do this / Don't do this" panels
- **Hierarchy visuals**: Team structure as a visual tree, not just text

### Scene composition rules:
- Maximum 40% of screen area is plain text
- Minimum 30% is visual elements (boxes, diagrams, icons)
- Background: warm paper tone (#f7f3eb), NOT white
- Grid lines for notebook feel
- Colored accent bars on top and left

### Keyword highlighting rules (CONSISTENT):
- ALL defined terms get highlighted in blue (#2563eb) + bold the FIRST time in each scene
- ALL values/principles get highlighted (not just some)
- ALL numbers/percentages get highlighted in a colored circle or box
- Highlighting must be SYSTEMATIC, never random

## RULE 5: AUDIO-VISUAL SYNC
- Words on screen MUST appear at the EXACT moment they are spoken (using ElevenLabs word timestamps)
- Visual elements (boxes, diagrams) appear when their related content is being narrated
- Nothing should appear on screen that isn't currently being discussed in audio
- Nothing should be discussed in audio without a corresponding visual element

## RULE 6: SELF-QA CHECKLIST — Run BEFORE every render
Before rendering ANY video, verify ALL of these:
- [ ] Does this video use any term not yet defined? → If yes, either add a definition or reorder.
- [ ] Does every sentence pass the "would a person with no industry knowledge understand this?" test?
- [ ] Are there at least 2 visual elements per content scene (boxes, diagrams, icons)?
- [ ] Are ALL keywords highlighted consistently (not just some)?
- [ ] Is audio-visual sync using exact word timestamps?
- [ ] Is there a practical example with literal dialogue or numbers?
- [ ] Does it end with a recall question?
- [ ] Is the total duration under 2.5 minutes?
- [ ] Does the "sale mantra" appear where appropriate?
- [ ] Would I (Santi) be proud to show this to Pau? If not, what needs fixing?

## RULE 7: PRODUCTION WORKFLOW
1. Write the narration script (JSON)
2. Run the Self-QA checklist (Rule 6)
3. Fix ALL issues found
4. Run QA again
5. Only THEN generate audio + render
6. Watch the rendered video yourself — does it look professional?
7. If not, fix and re-render (audio is cached, no ElevenLabs cost)
8. Only show to Pau when you'd rate it 8/10 or higher

## RULE 8: RECURRING REMINDERS
These messages must be woven into the content at natural points throughout the curriculum:
- "Every conversation has one goal: a SALE." (every section)
- "You earn 2% of every net sale. The more you sell, the more you make." (money-related videos)
- "Talk to your Team Leader through Discord, using VOICE. Not text." (team-related videos)
- "If you don't know a word, ask. There are no stupid questions." (early videos)

## RULE 9: CRITICAL MINDSET (mentalidad de tiburón)
- Question every decision. "Is this the best way?" not "Is this good enough?"
- Never assume the audience knows something. When in doubt, explain.
- Never deliver mediocre work. If it's not at least 8/10 quality, redo it.
- Prioritize what's best for the SCHOOL and the LEARNER, not what's fastest to produce.
- Be honest about limitations and propose alternatives.
