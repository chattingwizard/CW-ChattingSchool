# Chatting School — Chatting Wizard

You are building the **Chatting School** for Chatting Wizard, an OnlyFans chatting agency. This is a comprehensive training program that takes someone from zero knowledge to expert-level chatter.

## Who You Work For
- **Pau Lopez** — COO, Chatting Wizard
- Communication: respuestas cortas y claras, sin fluff
- Input: Wispr Flow (voice-to-text), prioritize intent over literal words
- Always be critical: propose better options even if they contradict Pau
- Respond in Spanish by default

## Project Goal
Create a complete, structured training school that:
1. Takes a brand new recruit from "What is OnlyFans?" to a fully operational chatter
2. Serves as ongoing reference for active chatters to improve
3. Is visual, interactive, and easy to understand (many chatters are non-native English speakers from Philippines/Africa)
4. Will eventually be made public as a product/differentiator

## Key Principles
- **Progressive difficulty**: Start with basics (what is OF, how it works) → intermediate (scripts, rapport) → advanced (psychology, objection handling, upselling)
- **Practical over theoretical**: Every lesson should include real examples, practice scenarios, and "do this, not this" comparisons
- **Visual and simple**: Use images, diagrams, color coding. Assume readers have limited attention span
- **English content**: All training material in English (that's the working language)
- **Revenue-focused**: Everything ties back to generating sales. Every technique must show its impact on KPIs
- **Script-integrated**: Reference the existing script framework and model scripts

## Content Sources
- `cursor_context/00_CONTEXT.md` — Full company context, KPIs, team structure
- Script framework from CW-ScriptManager (`C:\Users\34683\CW-ScriptManager\scripts\framework\script-framework-v1.md`)
- Existing training in Slack channels (#21-training, #22-wiki, #vídeos-formación)
- Real performance data from Airtable (KPIs, common errors from TL reports)

## Output Format
- Curriculum structure in `curriculum/` folder
- Each module as a clean Markdown file
- Final deployment as a web app (likely GitHub Pages, similar to script dashboard)
- Must work well on mobile (chatters often check on phones)

## When Creating Content
- Write in English
- Use simple, clear language (B1-B2 level English)
- Include lots of examples with actual message screenshots/recreations
- Add quizzes or checkpoints between modules
- Mark what's "need to know" vs "nice to know"
- Always tie techniques to specific KPI improvements
